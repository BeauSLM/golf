To run the GoLF reference compiler:

% cd reference
% ./golf 				(for options)
% ./golf -h				(for options)

Use the reference compiler's command-line options to stop and see its
output at earlier stages.  At present only the scanner output is available.

% ./golf testfile			(for scanner output)

Apart from any errors and warnings that might be detected, the scanner
output is a list of tokens, one per line.  Each token has three pieces
of information: the token type (printed first); the lexeme enclosed
in square brackets; the line number.  Note that the EOF is implicit in
the list ending, so there's no explicit EOF token being shown here.
Inserted semicolons have an empty lexeme that distinguishes them from
any tokenized semicolons that appear in the input.
